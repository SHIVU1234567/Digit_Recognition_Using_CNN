# Digit_Recognition_Using_CNN
**Overview:**
Digit recognition is a common problem in machine learning where the goal is to classify images of handwritten digits (typically ranging from 0 to 9). One of the most widely used approaches for solving this problem is through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a specialized type of neural network designed to process structured grid data, such as images. CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition tasks because they can automatically learn hierarchical features (like edges, textures, and patterns) without requiring manual feature extraction.

**Implementation Steps:**
Install Dependencies: Install libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Import Libraries: Import necessary modules for building and training the model.
Load Dataset: Load the MNIST dataset (train and test).
Preprocess Data: Reshape and normalize the images for CNN.
Build the CNN Model: Define the architecture (conv, pooling, dense layers).
Compile the Model: Choose optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Train the Model: Train the CNN using the training data and validate.
Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test data.
Visualize Training: Plot accuracy and loss curves to check model performance.
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict digits from test images.
Test with Custom Image (Optional): Optionally, use custom images for predictions.
Save and Load Model (Optional): Save the trained model for future use.
